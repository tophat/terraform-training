# Excercise 3: Output Variables

Similiar to Excercise 2, this test will fail due to missing output variable

Fix this by adding the wanted output variable needed.

```
# Only need to be ran once for all tests
go get github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform
go test -v -run excercise_3_test.go
```
