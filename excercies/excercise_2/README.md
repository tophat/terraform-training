# Excercise 2: Input Variables (pt 2)

Continuing on from excercise_1, we will now go about adding a new input variable. The test here will fail due to input variable not existing. 

Fix this by adding the wanted input variable.

```
# Only need to be ran once for all tests
go get github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform
go test -v -run excercise_2test.go
```
