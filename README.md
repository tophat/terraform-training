# terraform-training

Learn to write terraform by actually writing code (urm, i mean templates).

If wanting to read through general terraform docs refer to here: https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html

# What is terraform-training?

The goal of this repo is to get you familiar with writing terraform templates. Currently the focus is on using AWS as your cloud provider. Each excercise's goal is to introduce you to a singular concept within terraform. Will start out super simple and grow more complex as you do more excercises.

# Usage

- `. script/bootstrap`
- `cd excercise/excercise_1`
- Read the README
- `go test -v -run excercise_1_test.go`
- Fix the issue by updating the tempaltes in `excercises/excercise_1/terraform`
